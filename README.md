# HTML-CSS-Resume-Projects-Website
I came to a personal problem of stressfully in search of software developer/data scientist internships, I figured out one way to show skills and techniques I learned throughout my university career is to create a website showing off my personal resume and projects I have created. This is a idea where I can network myself to industries and companies to prove I can create something and prove myself that I can show my creativity and tell myself that I did learn something.
